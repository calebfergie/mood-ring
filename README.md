Code repository for the 'Mood Ring' Project

Created using:
1. An express app with the EJS view
2. The facial recognition program by auduno (https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr)
3. An arduino with the neopixel library, connected to the express app through serial communication (nodeserial)

Most of the customized code in this project can be found int the arduino folder and the 'mood-ring.ejs' file in the 'views folder'
